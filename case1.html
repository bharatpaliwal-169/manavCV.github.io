            After a careful analysis of the Hearing Aid Academy website, I drew the following conclusion of why it needed a redesign:
            <ul class="mt-3">
                <li>The website looks outdated.</li>
                <li>There was no trust building up when the user sees it for the first time.</li>
                <li>The brand values of the company were not clearly visible on the website.</li>
                <li>No way to understand the delivery process for users who don't know about it.</li>

            This was the first website I created professionally during my first internship asUI/UX Designer. <br>
            It was a rollercoaster for me since it was the first time I faced a client on my own and their reviews
            always made me go mad at first. 
            Eventually I got okay with bearing reviews and within 2-3 weeks, 
            I completed their website redesign and they were finally happy with it.
